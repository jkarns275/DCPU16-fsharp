# DCPU16-fsharp

A work in progress DCPU16 emulator (and eventually assembler) written in f#

Also I wouldn't recomend writing emulators in functional languages unless you are highly skilled in them...
this was my first F# project and, although I learned a lot, I couldn't fully use "functional" style programming
because of the nature of emulator programming, it is simply the wrong tool for the job.
